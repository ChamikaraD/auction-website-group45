                <h2>Welcome to NumisLive</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2025 in the heart of Sri Lanka, NumisLive was born from a lifelong passion for numismatics—the study and collection of currency. Our founder, a dedicated collector, saw an opportunity to create a modern, trusted, and accessible platform where fellow enthusiasts could discover, bid on, and sell rare and valuable coins from around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What started as a small project has grown into a premier online auction house, connecting a global community of collectors, from seasoned experts to curious newcomers. We believe every coin tells a story, and our mission is to be the bridge that shares those stories with the world.
